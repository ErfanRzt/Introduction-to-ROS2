## ðŸ§­ Setup

Follow the steps below to set up your environment and complete the assignment.

### 1. Create a ROS2 Workspace

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
```

### 2. Copy the Assignment Package

Copy the provided ROS2 package (e.g. `rpros2_week1_assignment`) into your workspace:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
cp -r /path/to/rpros2_week1_assignment .
```

### 3. Build the Assignment Package

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

### 4. Modify the Student Sections

Open the package source files and complete the parts marked with:

```python
# >>>>>>>>>>> STUDENT IMPLEMENTATION >>>>>>>>>>>
#
# TODO: Write your code in here.
#
# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
```

Make sure your code runs correctly and meets the assignment objectives.

## `Week 1` Turtlesim Target Visualization and Teleop 

### Assignment Task: 
your first projects involves developing a turtlesim visualizer and keyboard teleoperation. there exist two nodes called turtle_keyboard_control and turtle_target_plot respectively handle publishing velocity commands to `/turtle1/cmd_vel` and subscribing to `/turtle1/pose`. the first node controls the robot using keyboard and the second node runs a plotter that shows turtle's pose and orientation with a randomly plced box that whenever the robot reaches there, it disapears and teleports to another random place. there is also a lauch file `turtle_target_teleop.launch.py` that should spawn all the nodes together plus the `turtlesim_node`. modify the `STUDENT IMPLEMENTATION` share the result of your code.

### Reuslts:
here is a sample markdown code for sharing Figures. it could be .png, .jpg, or .gif files. save your figures in the folder `./figures/rpros2_week1/`
